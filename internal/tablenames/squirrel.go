package tablenames

// Squirrel is the Squirrel table backend (internal/codegen/squirreltable).
// Its runtimes are separate modules, schema_table_<name>.nut, loaded beside
// the unit's generated files (docs/PORT-SQUIRREL.md, THE RUNTIME LAYOUT), so
// the names they export live on the runtime's own exports table and no schema
// declaration can collide with them. They are registered anyway, the way a
// scoped runtime name is: the registry answers for every spelling the emitted
// text carries.
const Squirrel Backend = 1 << 11 // 1<<9 is Lua's and 1<<10 is Luau's, on their own streams
