C does NOT emit this spelling: an object-like macro carrying a common PascalCase identifier rewrites it everywhere in the consumer's own translation unit, which no front end can refuse, so the C backend spells the value SCHEMA_<PKG>_BUILD_VERSION_VALUE under the reserved prefix (internal/check's cReservedMacros)", RustConst: true},
