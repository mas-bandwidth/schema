# make/python.mk — the PYTHON leg (docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, "Adding a language";
# docs/PORT-PYTHON.md is the port's design). Included by the Makefile's
# wildcard include; the Makefile names no language. The leg registers itself
# at the end of this file.
#
# Scaffolded by `schema new-leg python`. The pinned interpreters and analyzer
# are make/python-toolchain.mk's; serialize.py, the bit layer, is
# make/python-serialize.mk's. The target is behind the schema_leg_python build
# tag until the packet layer (compiler/target_python.go), so its tests build
# the compiler with the tag.

# test-python: the leg's make test half. The toolchain and serialize.py
# (python-toolchain-check, its control, python-serialize-test) are
# prerequisites from their own fragments; here the emitter's package, which
# generates into temp directories and runs the generated package under both
# pinned interpreters and the analyzer (internal/codegen/python/pyrun), and
# the target through the compiler's driver in the tagged build.
